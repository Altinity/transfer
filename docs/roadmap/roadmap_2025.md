## 1. Kubernetes Operator for Multi-Transfer Deployments

### Objective:
Develop a **Kubernetes operator** to manage multiple data transfers, simplifying the process for large-scale environments.

### Steps:
- [ ] Define CRD (Custom Resource Definitions) for transfer configurations.
- [ ] Implement operator logic for scaling and managing multi-transfer deployments.
- [ ] Add support for monitoring, scaling, and error recovery.
- [ ] Write user documentation for deploying and managing transfers via the operator.

### Milestone:
Provide a scalable solution for managing multiple data transfers in Kubernetes environments with an operator.
