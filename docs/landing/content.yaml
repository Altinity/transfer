    title: Frequently asked questions
    items:
      - title: What's the difference between serverless and dedicated mode?
        text: >-
          In serverless mode, you don't need to pay attention to how many worker
          nodes are working and you don't need to adjust that number manually.
          DoubleCloud Transfer will automatically scale up and scale out the
          mode depending on the amount of data you have at your source.
          Dedicated mode is when you need extra security and isolation from
          other customers. Also, in that mode, you can establish VPC peering
          with other AWS accounts. You will have dedicated virtual machines
          under the hood for use only for you in that mode.
      - title: What type of synchronization/transfer do you support?
        text: |
          DoubleCloud Transfer supports three modes of synchronization:
          - Full snapshot
          - Log-based replication or CDC (Change data capture)
          - Key-based replication
          - Snapshot + log-based replication
      - title: >-
          How can I avoid transferring data from my AWS account via the
          internet?
        text: >-
          You can do so by setting up VPC peering in the DoubleCloud console,
          and using DoubleCloud Transfer in dedicated mode.
      - title: Does DoubleCloud provide a public API?
        text: >-
          We provide the ability to deploy, modify, and manage all four of our
          services, including creating and deploying charts and dashboards via
          an API, which is available through the Python SDK, GO SDK or directly
          through gRPC.

          text: Learn more
          theme: normal
          arrow: true
      - title: Which modes support automatic scaling?
        text: >-
          Serverless mode supports automatic scaling, whereas scaling in
          dedicated mode is manual.
      - title: What is Change Data Capture? Does DoubleCloud Transfer support it?
        text: >-
          In databases, Change Data Capture is a set of software design patterns
          used to determine and track data that has changed, so that actions can
          be taken using the changed data. 


          DoubleCloud Transfer supports Change Data Capture, but only for
          sources that support that on their side, e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL,
          MongoDB, and others.
      - title: What is VPC Peering?
        text: >-
          VPC Peering is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables
          you to route traffic between them both using private IPv4 addresses or
          IPv6 addresses.
      - title: How does key-based replication work?
        text: >-
          Key-based replication is a method in which a column called a
          Replication Key is used to identify new and updated data.
      - title: What is snapshot replication?
        text: >-
          Snapshot replication distributes data exactly as it appears at a
          specific moment in time and does not monitor for updates to the data.
